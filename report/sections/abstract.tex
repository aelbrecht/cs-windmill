In this paper we will try to identify windmill parks in the ocean based on satellite imagery. A convolutional neural network (CNN) was trained to detect individual windmills and boats. Land coverage maps and noise reduction techniques were applied in the preprocessing phase to improve training. Density-based clustering algorithms (DBSCAN and OPTICS) were compared in order to optimize the intermediate results. The final result is a generated Esri-shapefile that encircles all identified parks with a polygon.
