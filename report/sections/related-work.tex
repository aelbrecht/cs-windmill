The most relevant project we found to what we set out to do is a project developed in Duke University that is planning to map the energy infrastructure of the world using satellite imagery \cite{duke}. They began with mapping all windmills in the USA and explained their approach \cite{duke_github} using a combination of machine learning and simulated imagery. They applied their model on colored satellite imagery.\\

Another related project is written on Medium \cite{moraite_2019} which explained how it is relatively easy to identify ships using a CNN. This article has no sources for its data set due to link-rot, we assume it is related to another project using a different approach \cite{sagar_2019}. In both cases we can see that they used high resolution color satellite imagery.\\
