In this report we try to identify windmill parks in the ocean based on satellite imagery. A convolutional neural network was trained to detect individual windmills and boats. Land coverage maps and noise reduction techniques were applied in the preprocessing phase. Density based clustering algorithms (DBSCAN and OPTICS) were compared in order to optimize the intermediate result. The final result is a generated Esri shapefile that encircles all identified parks with a polygon.
